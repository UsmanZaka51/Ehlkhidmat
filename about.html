                                    In early 2020, all the students (founder and co-founders) were free from universities due to pandemic of Covid-19. In those days, the pandemic was at its peak. The life of every person was froze and it was expected that the progress of world had stopped and no one knows for how much time that disaster would last. A lot of people became jobless as most of the businesses were ceased at once. People were feeling entirely helpless. In those sequences of life, a few friends (less than 10) sat together and decided to do something productive because doing something useful is far way better than doing nothing. They decided to do something that would help the hopeless people. They decided to overcome the hunger. Ehl-e-Khidmat was established on 18th March 2020.<br>
                                    In that case they planned to feed a family of a widow who was unable to earn and feed her children. The journey began with giving ration to that one family. Those friends collected one hundred rupees each and bought ration for that family. After that they wished to help more deserving people, especially the families who have no source of income. In that way, each of them contacted their family members and relatives and informed them of their noble intentions. Along with that, they started bringing their classmates along with them. As a result, some new students joined Ehl-e-Khidmat, we were able to provide ration to more than one family. This journey slowly continued on its way and one by one members joined us. As the number of students increased, we added more families and provided them with ration. The donations were entirely from the pocket money of students. Our priority was to help widows who had no breadwinner to support their families.<br>
                                    Apart from this, we also included some families of other than widows and orphans, who were really in need. In the same way, this series continued and by the Grace of Allah, today, the number of our members is increasing and we are trying to help the deserving people as much as possible. If the intention of a person is good, Allah paves the way for him. So if you also want to help people around you then join us.<br>
